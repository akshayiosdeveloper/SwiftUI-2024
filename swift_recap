| Concept          | Keyword  | Mutable | Can be nil?         | Example                 |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Constant         | `let`    | ❌       | ❌ (unless optional) | `let age = 30`          |
| Variable         | `var`    | ✅       | ❌ (unless optional) | `var name = "Sam"`      |
| Optional         | `?`      | ✅       | ✅                   | `var name: String?`     |
| Forced Unwrap    | `!`      | -       | -                   | `name!`                 |
| Optional Binding | `if let` | -       | -                   | `if let name = name {}` |
| Nil-Coalescing   | `??`     | -       | -                   | `name ?? "Guest"`       |

| Statement     | Purpose                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `break`       | Exit current loop/switch early |
| `continue`    | Skip to next iteration         |
| `fallthrough` | Continue to next `switch` case |
| `return`      | Exit from function             |

| Feature             | Raw Values                      | Associated Values                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose             | Assign constant value           | Attach custom data to cases                |
| Value Type          | Must be same type for all cases | Can vary in type and number across cases   |
| Set at declaration? | ✅ Yes                           | ❌ No, provided when creating enum instance |
| Access              | `case.rawValue`                 | `switch` pattern matching                  |
| Example             | `.monday.rawValue` → `"Mon"`    | `.failure(errorCode: 404)`                 |

| Feature               | Raw Values                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Type requirement      | Must be same for all cases                     |
| Why?                  | To allow `.rawValue` access and initialization |
| Enforced by compiler? | ✅ Yes                                          |

=== properties ====
📌 Interview Summary (Cheat Sheet)
Type	Stores Value?	When Used?	Example Use Case
Stored	✅ Yes	Keep simple data	var name: String
Computed	❌ No	Derived value	area = width * height
Lazy Stored	✅ (delayed)	Expensive init, depends on self	lazy var db = Database()
Property Observers	✅ (monitors)	Track changes	didSet { ... }
👀 Property Observers in Swift

👉 Definition:
Property observers are blocks of code that run whenever the value of a property changes.
They let you react to changes instead of recomputing values like computed properties.

✅ Types of Property Observers

There are two observers:

willSet

Called before the value is changed.

The new value is passed as a constant (newValue by default, or you can give it a custom name).

didSet

Called after the value is changed.

The old value is passed as a constant (oldValue by default).

📌 Rules to Remember

You can use both willSet and didSet together or only one.

They can be applied to stored properties (var, not let).

They cannot be applied to lazy properties (since lazy is initialized only once).

They are not called during initialization (inside init or at declaration).

They can be added to inherited properties by overriding.
