What is a Protocol?<br>
==
A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that a class, structure, or enumeration must implement.

Think of protocols as contracts that types agree to follow.
Protocols donâ€™t provide implementations; they only specify what should be implemented.

**==example==** <br>
protocol Vehicle {
    var speed: Double { get set } // Property
    func startEngine()           // Method
    func stopEngine()            // Method
}

class Car: Vehicle {
    var speed: Double = 0.0
    
    func startEngine() {
        print("Car engine started.")
    }
    
    func stopEngine() {
        print("Car engine stopped.")
    }
}

**// Usage**<br>
let car = Car()
car.startEngine()
car.speed = 60.0
print("Speed: \(car.speed)")

**===    Key Features of Protocols  ====** <br>
Multiple Protocol Conformance
A type can conform to multiple protocols.

protocol Drivable {
    func drive()
}

protocol Repairable {
    func repair()
}

struct Truck: Drivable, Repairable {
    func drive() {
        print("Truck is driving.")
    }

    func repair() {
        print("Truck is being repaired.")
    }
}


2)**** Protocol Composition**** <br>
Combine multiple protocols into one requirement using &.

func performTask(vehicle: Vehicle & Drivable) {
    vehicle.startEngine()
    vehicle.drive()
}
3) **Optional Requirements (for @objc Protocols)**
Protocols marked with @objc can have optional methods.

@objc protocol OptionalExample {
    @objc optional func optionalMethod()
}

class ExampleClass: OptionalExample {
    // No need to implement `optionalMethod` unless required.
}

4) **Protocol Extensions**
Extensions allow adding functionality to protocols, including default method implementations.
This is the foundation of protocol-oriented programming.

**Associated Types in Protocols** <br>
An associated type in a protocol is a placeholder for a type that will be specified later, when the protocol is adopted. It allows you to define flexible and reusable protocols that work with different types without being tied to a specific one.

**//------ Clousures----------- ** <br>
==

**Trailing Clousure :** <br>
==
A trailing closure is a Swift feature that makes code more readable when the last parameter of a function is a closure. Instead of passing the closure inside the function's parentheses, you write it outside, after the function call. This is especially useful when the closure is long or complex.
Summary of Trailing Closure Scenarios
**Scenario	Example** <br>
Network Requests	Fetching data from an API and handling the result with a trailing closure.
Animations	Defining animation behavior and completion logic with trailing closures.
Sorting/Filtering	Using trailing closures with higher-order functions like sorted, map, etc.

**Key Benefits of Trailing Closures**<br>

Improved Readability:

Trailing closures make the code cleaner, especially when the closure is long or contains multiple lines of logic.

Separation of Concerns:

The function call and the closure logic are visually separated, making the code easier to understand.

Common in Real-World Code:

Trailing closures are widely used in Swift for asynchronous tasks, animations, and higher-order functions.

Autoclosure : 
==
In Swift, an autoclosure is a special kind of closure that automatically wraps an expression into a closure. It allows you to delay the evaluation of an expression until it is explicitly called, which can be useful for optimizing performance or controlling when an expression is evaluated.

Key Points about Autoclosures:
==
Automatic Closure Creation:

When you mark a parameter with @autoclosure, the compiler automatically wraps the expression you pass as an argument into a closure.

This means the expression isn't evaluated immediately when passed to the function; instead, it's evaluated only when the closure is called.

Syntax:
==

Use the @autoclosure attribute before the parameter type in a function declaration.

The parameter type must be a closure that takes no arguments and returns a value of a specific type.

Lazy Evaluation:
==

Autoclosures are useful for lazy evaluation, where you want to defer the evaluation of an expression until it's actually needed.

This can improve performance, especially if the expression is computationally expensive or if it might not always be needed.

Common Use Cases:
==

The assert function in Swift uses @autoclosure to avoid evaluating the condition in release builds.

Short-circuiting operators like && and || also use autoclosures to evaluate the second operand only if necessary.

No Arguments:
==
Autoclosures cannot take any arguments. They are always of the form () -> T, where T is the return type.

# My Swift Project

Here is a Swift code snippet:

```swift
func example(_ condition: @autoclosure () -> Bool) {
    if condition() {
        print("Condition is true")
    } else {
        print("Condition is false")
    }
}
example(5 > 3) // The expression `5 > 3` is automatically wrapped into a closure.
